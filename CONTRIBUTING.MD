# Contributing Guidelines

We hope you are enjoying Docker and look forward to hearing your feedback. Whether you want to raise a bug report, a feature request or just request a correction to something we really value our community input.

We do ask though that you read all of this document you send us any issues or raise pull requests to make sure we understand clearly what you are asking for, this helps us make sure we are making the right decisions and taking the right actions.  

## Feature Requests

You are very welcome to create new issues on this project to request new features in any of Docker products.

If you would like to suggest a new feature we ask that you please use our issue template. This contains a few essential questions that help us understand the problem you are looking to solve and how you think your reocommendation will address it. We alsotag incoming issues from this template with "community_new".  This lets our teams quickly see what has been raised and better find our community recommendations

To see what has already been proposed by the community you can look [here](https://github.com/docker/docker-roadmap/labels/community_new).

Watch our for duplicates! If you are creating a new issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/docker/docker-roadmap/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/docker/docker-roadmap/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20) . Having a single voted for issue is far easier for us to prioritize 

## Reporting Bugs

We would ask that you please don't use this repo to raise bugs, each of our products has it's own repo where issues relating to that product are raised. We have chosen to do this as our products are all quiet different and as a result we need quite different information for each product to best understand how to help you.

To raise a bug please use:
* [Docker Hub](https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/new)
* [Docker Desktop Windows](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/new)
* [Docker Desktop Mac](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/new)
* [Docker Engine](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)
